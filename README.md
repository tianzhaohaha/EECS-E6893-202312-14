### Team 14: Shaokun Feng(sf3209), Qingyuan Liu(ql2505), Xinzi Yu(xy2590)

 

**This project presents a comprehensive exploration into leveraging Big Data Analysis to predict stock prices using Spatio-Temporal Graph data. Focused on S&P 500 companies, the study delves into the complexities of financial markets, aiming to construct dynamic relationships between companies and develop predictive models. The report outlines meticulous data collection, preprocessing methodologies, and the development of predictive modelsâ€”LSTM for temporal data and STGCN for static and dynamic Spatio-Temporal data. It discusses experimental outcomes, visualization strategies, and references recent works in the field. The endeavor seeks to contribute to revolutionizing**  **financial forecasting and decision-making processes by enhancing**  **predictive analytics in the financial domain.**
